## Abstract

This UIP proposes the adoption of standardized testing practices across the Urbit ecosystem, encompassing both Arvo and Vere. It formalizes a single, comprehensive reference—"Urbit Testing: Standards & Recommendations"—as the canonical document outlining best practices for unit, integration, regression, and property testing. The aim is to improve software correctness, developer onboarding, and long-term maintainability of the Urbit stack by institutionalizing a culture of structured, thoughtful testing.

## Motivation

Historically, Urbit’s development emphasized correctness and conceptual elegance, yet testing infrastructure and discipline remained ad hoc and unevenly applied. This fragmentation leads to:

- Undocumented expectations for contributors,
- Difficulties catching regressions across Kelvin decrements,
- Inconsistent practices between Arvo and Vere,
- Limited visibility into test coverage via CI.

By unifying standards and aligning expectations across the ecosystem, we address all of the above. The functional design of Arvo benefits tremendously from unit and property testing. Meanwhile, Vere, with its C-based imperative design and memory management, requires traditional discipline around static analysis, fuzzing, and anomaly detection. This UIP captures and formalizes the best emerging practices from both contexts, and codifies them in a single reference document meant to evolve with the ecosystem.

## Specification

This proposal designates the document titled **Urbit Testing: Standards & Recommendations** authored by `~hanfel-dovned` as the official community standard for Urbit testing practices. This document:

- Codifies **unit testing requirements** for core Arvo libraries, agents, and marks.
- Establishes **regression testing** policy as mandatory for all bug fixes, requiring reproducible and permanent test cases.
- Suggests **integration testing** responsibilities for Arvo vanes, threads, and generators.
- Recommends methodologies for **Vere unit and integration tests**, including structure, clarity, memory leak detection, jet correctness, and use of sanitizers.
- Encourages **CI transparency**, requiring all core repos to document their CI testing steps and expose relevant testing entry points.
- Details evolving practices such as **fuzz testing**, **boot testing**, **instrumentation**, and **protocol testing**, and provides implementation guidance.

This document is available at:  
**[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VJa9xflWz-a-yboFnlxIWBaxYxf1frXioUZLrckJDa4](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VJa9xflWz-a-yboFnlxIWBaxYxf1frXioUZLrckJDa4)** 
(*Final location to be updated before moving UIP to Last Call*)

Adoption of this document SHALL be reflected in:

- Code review processes for `urbit/urbit` and `urbit/vere`
- CI enforcement and PR requirements for new features or bug fixes
- Developer documentation and onboarding materials

**Urbit Testing: Standards & Recommendations** is intended to evolve as best practices mature. A lightweight governance process for proposing and reviewing updates to the document SHALL be established prior to this UIP entering Final status.

## Rationale

The rationale for each testing methodology, convention, and practice is embedded directly within the reference document. This UIP serves as a pointer to that evolving body of work.

## Backwards Compatibility

This UIP does not alter the behavior of existing code but RECOMMENDS a consistent review and enforcement policy going forward. Contributors MAY need to add tests retroactively when modifying untested components.

## Security Considerations

Adopting these standards improves the security posture of the Urbit codebase by:

- Catching regressions that may reintroduce known vulnerabilities
- Systematically identifying memory leaks and undefined behavior in Vere
- Ensuring correctness of cryptographic and jet implementations
- Enabling fuzz testing and instrumentation for unexpected input conditions
