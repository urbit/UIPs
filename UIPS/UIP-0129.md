## Abstract

Hoon supports several related runes for error handling and debugging:

- `~&` is the classic `printf` side-effect rune.
- `~|` adds a stack annotation in case of crash.
- `~?` adds a debugging printf
- `?>` is a positive assertion (crash if fail).
- `?<` is a negative assertion (crash if pass).

A common design pattern in Hoon is to have an assertion to succeed, then to wrap
an intended error mesage with `~|` around `!!`.  By coupling the `?:`, `~|`, and
`!!` together, we can achieve a more lapidary yet still clear code expression.
We propose to call this the `~.` sigdot rune (patterned after `?.` wutdot
"lest").

```
~:  test-to-pass
  'message-on-fail'
continuation if pass
```

The advantage of this rune is that it will avoid the footgun of an assertion
passing but the message still printing.  (I.e. you can do other things in a
`~|`-gated branch.)

## Specification

The `~.` rune should desugar from:

```
~.  test-to-pass
  'message-on-fail'
continuation if pass
```

to:

```
?.  test-to-pass
  ~|  'message-on-fail'  !!
continuation if pass
```

`~:` differs from `~?` in that it crashes with the error message (rather than
the conditional printf).

This involves two modest changes, one to the parser and another to the AST in
`/sys/hoon`.  `~.` collides with the empty `@ta`, `*knot`, but should be
generally distinguishable through precedence rules in syntax.

## Rationale

- Producing code that cleanly wraps an error message around an implicit crash is
  clear to read and write for many programmers.
- Offering a rune which allows `?.`-like assertion checks without incorrectly
  invoking other `~|` stack trace messages in case of error will make failures
  more clear to process.

## Backwards Compatibility

- This should be bundled into a Hoon kelvin decrement.  It will not break any
  known existing code.
