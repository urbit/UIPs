## Abstract

Seer is a monadic scry interface which allows application developers to
read from the namespace without using dotket (`.^`) or its virtual
Nock operator 12. Once we remove Nock 12, _all_ code in the system
can take advantage of persistent memoization.

## Motivation

dotket and Nock 12, which dotket compiles to, makes Nock _not_ referentially
transparent. By consequence, memoization is less effective.

In the interest of removing dotket and Nock 12 in the future, a replacement must
first be supplied. The replacement should attempt to be as ergonomic as dotket.

## Specification

Here's a Gall agent snippet that scries with `.^`:
```hoon
++  on-poke
  |=  [m=mark v=vase]
  ^-  (quip card _this)
  =/  foo-result  .^  @da  /cx/(now)/foo
  ::  do something with foo-result...
  [~ this]
```

Here's the same Gall agent snippet that scries with `seer` in the
continuation style:
```hoon
++  gear         ::  gall seer
  |*  a=mold
  (seer vase a)
++  on-poke
  |=  [m=mark v=vase]
  ^-  (gear (quip card _this))  ::  (seer vase (quip card _this))
  :+  %scry  /cx/(now)/foo  |=  foo=vase
  =/  foo-result  !<(@ foo)
  ::  do something with foo-result...
  [%done ~ this]
```

Here's an example of composing `seer` values with monadic bind:
```hoon
++  foo  ^-  (seer vase @)  !!  ::  /foo
++  bar  ^-  (seer vase @)  !!  ::  /bar
++  on-poke
  |=  [m=mark v=vase]
  =*  r  (quip card _this)
  ^-  (gear r)
  =/  bind  (rapt vase r)
  ;<  foo=@  bind  foo
  ;<  bar=@  bind  bar
  [%done ~ this(some-state (add foo bar))]
```

A `seer` is the type of programs that scry:
```hoon
++  seer
  |*  [r=mold a=mold]
  $~  [%done *a]
  $%  [%done p=a]
      [%scry p=path k=$-(r (seer r a))]
  ==
```

See the reference implementation for the monadic bind (`rapt`).

## Rationale

We believe `seer` degrades ergonomics only slightly while removing an ugly
wart that has plagued Urbit since its birth.

12 destroys the referential transparency of Nock, making every computation
dependent on a hidden context. This prevents transparent, system-wide
persistent memoization (among other things).

## Backwards Compatibility

The `seer` scry system is intentionally incompatible with the `.^` scry system.

We will support both scry styles for some time before deprecating and eventually
removing `.^`. In the meantime, we shall provide a wrapper library which accepts
an agent written in the `seer`-style and produces an agent that scries in the
`.^`-style.

## Security Considerations

A simpler system is a more secure system.
