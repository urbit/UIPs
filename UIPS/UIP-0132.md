## Abstract

This proposal aims to integrate Urbit's address space with the broader decentralized finance ecosystem by introducing a fungible ERC20 token called URBIT to represent unspawned planets. Through this system, star owners can convert their spawn capacity into tradeable tokens for use in DeFi activities such as trading and collateralization. The spawn capability for withdrawn tokens transfers to the Ecliptic contract, enabling direct planet minting without star involvement.

## Motivation

The current model treats spawn capacity as an intrinsic property of star ownership through NFTs. While NFTs excel at representing unique digital property, their non-fungible nature keeps address space largely isolated from major cryptocurrency markets and DeFi protocols. Currently, stars can only trade their planets by selling their entire star NFT or spawning and selling each planet individually. Although NFT marketplaces exist, they are poorly suited for continuous or high-volume trading. Converting spawn capacity to fungible planet tokens through the ERC20 standard opens up the broader landscape of blockchain infrastructure, allowing for access to deeper liquidity and capital flows.

### Upgrade Sequence

To introduce this system with minimal disruption, the following sequence is required:

1. Senate approval of the proposal and contract code
2. Deployment of the `PlanetToken` and `PlanetTreasury`, with no initial supply
3. Updating `Ecliptic` to reference the new contracts
4. Executing a one-time token minting process

## Specification

### PlanetToken Contract

The `PlanetToken` contract implements the standard ERC20 interface as a non-upgradeable contract with initial total supply calculated as (65,280 stars × 65,535 planets) minus all previously spawned planets.

### PlanetTreasury Contract

The `PlanetTreasury` is an upgradable contract designed to hold the initial token supply in escrow. Tokens remain locked in escrow until they are either withdrawn by the star owner through the `withdrawCapacity` function or burned during the planet spawning process. A `hasCapacity` mapping is used to track whether a star’s tokens are still held in escrow, which determines if the star maintains its ability to spawn planets. The star's spawning capacity can be replenished by invoking the `depositCapacity` function, where the star owner deposits tokens equivalent to the number of unspawned planets associated with the star.

During the spawn process, `Ecliptic` verifies that a star’s `hasCapacity` is true and then instructs `PlanetTreasury` to burn tokens on that star’s behalf.

### Changes to Ecliptic

Several modifications to `Ecliptic` are required to accommodate ERC20-based spawn capacity. Upon an attempted spawn, `Ecliptic` checks if the star has capacity in `PlanetTreasury`. If not, the spawn fails; if it does, `PlanetToken` burns the necessary token(s).

## Rationale

This approach intentionally keeps the Azimuth system intact and avoids redeploying the `Azimuth` contract. Since Azimuth is non-upgradeable, it cannot simply accept a new field such as `hasCapacity` for all star points. Although this design results in two “sources of truth”—one for ownership and one for capacity—it prevents a network-wide overhaul.

Tokenizing planets without altering the underlying `Point` struct follows a minimal-disruption philosophy. Owners uninterested in ERC20 markets can retain their spawn capacity in escrow as before, while others can move capacity into a liquid ERC20 market.

## Conclusion

This design balances trade-offs between architectural purity, system complexity, and practicality of deployment. By tokenizing spawn capacity, the proposal connects Urbit’s address space with established DeFi markets and trading venues, unlocking greater liquidity, price discovery, and economic possibilities. Although participation in this token-based system is optional, it can serve as a catalyst for broader awareness and engagement, drawing more attention to Urbit’s address space and fostering deeper integration with the wider blockchain ecosystem.
