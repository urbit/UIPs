## Abstract

This proposal aims to integrate Urbit's address space with the broader decentralized finance ecosystem by introducing a fungible ERC20 token called `URBIT` to represent unspawned planets. Through this system, star owners can convert their spawn capacity into tradeable tokens for use in DeFi activities such as trading and collateralization. The spawn capability for withdrawn tokens transfers to the `ecliptic.eth` contract, enabling direct planet minting without star involvement.

## Motivation

The current model treats spawn capacity as an intrinsic property of star ownership through NFTs. While NFTs excel at representing unique digital property, their non-fungible nature keeps address space largely isolated from major cryptocurrency markets and DeFi protocols. Currently, stars can only trade their planets by selling their entire star NFT or spawning and selling each planet individually. Although NFT marketplaces exist, they are poorly suited for continuous or high-volume trading. Converting spawn capacity to fungible planet tokens through the ERC20 standard opens up the broader landscape of blockchain infrastructure, allowing for access to deeper liquidity and capital flows.

### Upgrade Sequence

To introduce this system with minimal disruption, the following sequence is required:

1. Senate approval of the proposal and contract code
2. Deployment of the `PlanetToken` and `PlanetTreasury`, with no initial supply
3. Updating `ecliptic` to reference the new contracts
4. Executing a one-time token minting process

## Specification

### PlanetToken Contract

The `PlanetToken` contract implements the standard ERC20 interface as a non-upgradeable contract with initial total supply calculated as (65,280 stars × 65,535 planets) minus all previously spawned planets.

### PlanetTreasury Contract

The `PlanetTreasury` is an upgradable contract designed to hold the initial token supply in escrow. Stars can convert their spawn capacity into `URBIT` tokens by assigning their spawn proxy to the `PlanetTreasury` contract, which releases the corresponding tokens from escrow to the star owner. Tokens are burned whenever planets are spawned. Star owners can regain direct control of their spawn proxy by returning tokens equivalent to their remaining unspawned planets.

### Changes to Ecliptic

The existing spawn proxy mechanism in `ecliptic` will be utilized without modification to its core functionality. The `ecliptic` will need to recognize the `PlanetTreasury` as a special spawn proxy, with a condition in the `setSpawnProxy` function that prevents reassigning a spawn proxy from `PlanetTreasury` except by `PlanetTreasury` itself (when tokens are returned). No additional state tracking functionality will be added to `ecliptic`.

## Rationale

This approach intentionally minimizes changes to existing Urbit infrastructure by utilizing the spawn proxy mechanism rather than creating new integration points. The single conditional check in `ecliptic` avoids introducing new state variables while enabling the desired token functionality.

The one-time minting strategy creates a proper deflationary token model that accurately represents the finite nature of the address space. By minting the entire supply at launch and only burning tokens, the standard ERC20 `totalSupply()` function correctly reflects the true circulating supply, maintaining compatibility with existing infrastructure like Etherscan and DeFi protocols. A perpetual mint/burn system would be problematic because `totalSupply()` would only show currently minted tokens rather than the maximum potential supply, requiring non-standard tracking functions that break compatibility with ERC20 tooling.

## Conclusion

This design balances trade-offs between architectural purity, system complexity, and practicality of deployment. By tokenizing spawn capacity, the proposal connects Urbit’s address space with established DeFi markets and trading venues, unlocking greater liquidity, price discovery, and economic possibilities. The lightweight implementation approach ensures minimal disruption to core systems while maximizing integration potential. Though participation in this token-based system remains entirely optional for star owners, it provides a complementary layer that can foster broader engagement with Urbit's address space ecosystem.
