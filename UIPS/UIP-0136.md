## Abstract

This UIP proposes three coordinated changes for comet identity and networking:

1) Allow Ames to query Jael for comet keys instead of requiring self-attestation from comets.
2) Introduce a cryptosuite that supports tweaked keys.
3) Allow comets to include routing information in `$point:jael` and allow Ames routing logic to avoid assuming Azimuth sponsorship hierarchies.

Collectively, these changes make comet identity cryptographically coupled to the PKI substrate it attests to, while remaining substrate-agnostic at the protocol level.

## Motivation

Groundwire’s thesis is pragmatic: over the long term, Bitcoin is the only chain that provides an unambiguous, protocol-level canonical history (the heaviest valid proof-of-work chain) that a Kelvin 0 Urbit could resolve without social coordination or trusted checkpoints. This suggests a clean long-term anchor for the Urbit PKI.

It is too early to propose that that belief be enforced by kernel policy. Moreover, Bitcoin's data and scripting models present a range of potential mechanisms for identity attestation that differ markedly from those possible on Ethereum. The new affordances and challenges of these options to a large extent can only be properly explored through real-world usage and iteration. Thus while Bitcoin's popular ordinal/inscription protocol is a functional and easy-to-reason-about initial choice of on-chain mechanism, it would also be premature to commit the kernel to these abstractions. Instead, Urbit should provide a general mechanism whereby comets can attest keys to any PKI source (chosen by a Jael `%listen` task) and peers can verify these attestations.

The vast majority of Urbit's 128-bit address space is allotted to ephemeral identities. The 32 bits under Azimuth's domain constituting a DNS-centralized hierarchical network of memorable names will be untouched. We seek to upgrade the rest of the Urbit universe to allow for self-sovereign networking.

## Specification

There are three main changes we propose to Arvo:

### 1. Allow Ames to query Jael for comet keys

- Replace `++request-attestation` with `++fetch-comet-pki`:
    - Ames **MUST** query Jael for the comet’s latest `life` and corresponding networking keys record.
    - If Jael has a record, Ames **MUST** use it to validate the sender’s keys. If not present, Ames **MAY** fall back to the self-attestation request.
- The `$point:jael` map from `life` to `[crypto-suite=@ud =pass]` remains the authoritative store.

### 2. Suite C Tweaked keys

- Replace the crypto Suite B core `+crub`, whose payload is: 
  ```
  pub=[cry=@ sgn=@]
  sek=(unit [cry=@ sgn=@])
  ```

  with a "Suite C" core `+cric` whose payload is:
  ```
  $%  $:  suite=%b
          pub=[cry=@ sgn=@ ~]
          sek=$@(~ [sed=@ cry=@ sgn=@])
      ==
      $:  suite=%c
          pub=[cry=@ sgn=@ tw=[ugn=@ dat=@ xtr=@]]
          sek=$@(~ [sed=@ cry=@ sgn=@])
      ==
  ==
  ```
  The first character of `pass`, being `b` or `c`, encodes which `+cric` case to use. In the `%c` case:
    - `sgn.pub` and `sgn.sek` are tweaked keys.
    - `ugn` is the untweaked signing public key.
    - `dat` is the tweak data, typically attesting to PKI choice (e.g., concatenation of `%btc` and a Bitcoin ordinal number).
    - `xtr` is an additional data field not included in the tweak.
    - `sed` is the random seed used to generate the untweaked keypair (so that it can be re-generated)

- Tweaking keys allows for a bidirectional cryptographic commitment between on-chain and off-chain (self-)attestations. The first generation of Groundwire comets, for example, use their tweak data to commit the key to the ordinal (indexed satoshi) that it will be inscribed on, as well as the name of the canonical agent used to validate it against Bitcoin chaindata. This serves to prevent a wide class of on-chain replay and spoofing attacks, as well as double-spawning across different on-chain attestation protocols if and when such usage takes place.
- Further, in cases where the comet is not already known to Jael at point of first contact this tweak data can serve to notify the contacted ship of where the comet persists its PKI state and how to validate it at message time. As a protocol scales, there are edge cases where this is always applicable, such as incomplete initial sync by a newly-booted contactee. Additionally, there are useful protocols for which it is intended behavior, such as "confidential comets" that commit their attestation to the Bitcoin chain without advertising it via inscription of the plaintext data, such that passive watcher agents cannot detect it and these ships are always unknown to peers they have not yet directly communicated with.

### 3. Fief-based comet routing

- **Jael extension:** Comet PKI entries **MAY** include a `$fief` encoding *either* a static IP/port (`%if` for IPV4 or `%is` for IPV6) or a domain (`%turf`):

    ```
    +$  fief  
        $%  [%turf p=(list turf) q=@udE]
            [%if   p=@ifF        q=@udE]
            [%is   p=@isH        q=@udE]
        ==
    ```

- **Ames routing changes:**
    - If a comet has a `$fief`, Ames **SHOULD** attempt routing according to `$fief` before falling back to sponsor-chain routing.
    - Sponsor-chain termination at galaxies **MUST NOT** be assumed.
      - Therefore, Ames **MUST** detect and avoid routing cycles.

## Backwards Compatibility

- All ships will continue to subscribe to `%azimuth` for galaxy, star, and planet networking keys.
- A peer that is unaware of a comet's networking keys in Jael (due to either party not adopting a new PKI) will continue to request a self-attestation, and the comet will continue to fulfill it.
- Suite B functionality is preserved within Suite C.
- Existing Azimuth-based routing remains; `$fief` is additive.

## Security Considerations

- As is already the case, Jael will accept PKI records from configured watchers via the `%listen` task. Operators **MUST** vet watchers they run; the kernel does not enforce a single source of truth. Misconfigured or malicious watchers could inject bogus records.
- The introduction of Suite C tweaked keys increases the cryptographic surface area. Implementations **MUST** take care to correctly derive, serialize, and verify tweak data and untweaked keys, as misuse or mis-binding could compromise key provenance or create non-interoperable signatures.

## Status

A prototype exists in the Groundwire organization's forks of `urbit/urbit` and `urbit/vere`, including Ames `+fetch-comet-pki`, Suite C `+cric`, and `$fief` handling.
