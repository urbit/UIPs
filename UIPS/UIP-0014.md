## Abstract

This PR introduces a new rune ?_(a=hoon b=wing), subject to renaming, whose compiled nock is equivalent to .=, but refines the type of b to that of a on noun equality.

## Specification

See https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/6656

## Rationale

Dependently typed maps. Dependently typed axals too, but as mentioned in PR, it seems exponential or factorial on the number of paths with gas, or something.

## Backwards Compatibility

This PR properly would at least modify map and ordered map, and should make sure that this doesn't break compilation everywhere those are used.
