## Abstract

The Hoon pretty printer (i.e. [standard library 5c][stdlib-5c]) is broadly
responsible for transforming `$type` and `$vase` nouns into `$tank`
equivalents, generally for the purpose of rendering these nouns in a
human-legible format. While its current implementation admirably performs this
task for nearly all simple and semi-complex nouns, it suffers from performance
and legibility problems for common nontrivial inputs such as meta-`$vase`
nouns, `%lull` types, and noun comparisons (e.g. via `+dext:nest:ut`).
Additionally, the pretty printer's limited set of customization options forces
all output to exist at one of two levels of abstraction: extremely verbose (the
default) or extremely terse (for types annotated with `$+`). This proposal
contains an array of suggestions to address these deficiencies in an iterative
and user-oriented manner.

## Motivation

There are numerous simple pretty printer invocations that render a ship
unusable or produce largely illegible results. The following is a short list of
common representative examples:

1. `!>(*)`, `+<..`: Processes for several minutes before ultimately crashing the
   ship with a `recover: dig: meme` error.
2. `->:!>(*noun)`: Fails to print any output, exiting with a `dojo: failed to
   process input` error.
3. `^-((unit dome:clay) *dome:clay)`: Produces nearly 900 lines of output for a
   difference spanning a single line.

The lack of per-type printing customization also makes it difficult to tune
the pretty printer's level of detail to the user's operative level of
abstraction. This presents problems most commonly for developers at both ends
of the abstraction range (i.e. core and app developers), who encounter troubles
with outputs for nouns like:

1. `-:!>(*peer-state:ames)`: Prints `#t/#peer-state`, which is unhelpful for a
   core developer attempting to debug/inspect this structure at a nontrivial
   level of detail.
2. `^-((tree [@t @]) (malt ~[[';' 1] [':' 2] ['!' 3]]))`: Prints the tree using
   set-like `{…}` syntax, which makes it difficult for a core developer that
   wants to see the node ordering of the underlying tree structure.
3. `mint:ut`: Prints the `+mint` arm using the pretty printer's `<X.abc …>`
   summary syntax, which is difficult to parse for an app developer trying to
   determine the function's signature (doccords helps with this somewhat,
   but cannot easily print door arms).

## Specification

> Joe (`~master-morzod`) had some interesting ideas for how to rewrite the pretty
> printer in a way that might be easier—and maybe even more principled—involving
> using the `%hint` type for types, treating that like a mark, and then
> allowing you to write a function that describes how data of that mark could be
> pretty printed. Then, you could write a pretty printer where the logic of the
> printer itself doesn't know anything about those (marks) and is a very dumb
> genric—and that could be really nice.

- In a similar vein to [`+easy-print`][stdlib-ep], develop a parallel version
  of the [`+us` door][stdlib-5c] that leverages the existing `[%hint [%know
  mark=@tas] …]` type structure to enable `%mark`-like type identification and
  corresponding custom printing functions. This new door will assume the
  temporary name `+ur`.
  - Introduce the concept of a pretty printer gate type `$ppin` with signature
    `$-([inp=(each type vase) bas=$-((each type vase) tank)] tank)`.
    - The `bas` argument is the base pretty printer gate that will be used by
      `+ur`, which is passed to each `$ppin` in order to enable recursive `$tank`
      building.
    - The following is a rough sketch of a `$ppin` gate for the `$unit` type:
      ```hoon
      |=  [inp=(each type vase) bas=$-((each type vase) tank)]
      ^-  tank
      ?-    -.inp
          %&  ::  type
        ?>  ?=(%hint -.p.inp)
        :+  %rose  [" " "u(" ")"]
        [(bas %& q.p.inp)]~
      ::
          %|  ::  vase
        ?>  ?=(%hold -.p.p.inp)
        =+  ;;(=type (slot 2 (~(play ut p.p.p.inp) q.p.p.inp)))
        :+  %rose  [" " "[" "]"]
        :~  [%leaf '~' ~]
            (bas %| type q.p.p.inp)
        ==
      ==
      ```
  - Make the `+ur` door sample a copy of `+us` with the additional internal
    state of a verbosity setting `veb` and a pretty printer map `pin`:
    ```hoon
    ++  ur
      =>  |%
          +$  ppin  $-([(each type vase) $-((each type vase) tank)] tank)
          --
      =+  :*  veb=*?(%base %most %lest)    ::  default verbosity
              pin=*(map term ppin)         ::  print overrides
          ==
      =+  sur=type
      ::  … arms start here …
    ```
    - `veb` is the verbosity setting used by the pretty printer for all type
      marks not spanned by `pin`, which has three proposed flavors: (1) `%base`
      (the current behavior), (2) `%most` (raw noun dumps), and `%lest`
      (aggressive `%know` name substitution)
    - `pin` enumerates a set of type marks and associated printing functions
      that will override the default `veb` printing behavior for those types.
  - Extract the heuristic type identification logic from `+dole:us` into a new
    gate `+doxx:ur` with signature `$-(type type)` that annotates the input
    with `%know` notes for the common types (e.g. `list`, `tree`, `unit`, etc.).
- Analogous to the above, create a parallel door to `+ut` nominally named `+uq`
  that contains a modified nesting algorithm in `+dext:nest:uq` that reports
  `$type` errors as diffs instead of a sequence of comparative dumps. This could
  be approached a couple of different ways:
  - *Text Diff*: Leverage the [text diffing
    algorithm](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/blob/develop/pkg/arvo/sys/zuse.hoon#L3966)
    currently in `zuse` to present a line-based diff.
  - *Tree Diff*: Leverage the [noun diffing
  algorithm](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/6681) implemented by
  `~racfer-hattes` (i.e. @ilyakooo0) in order to present a tree-based diff.
- Segregate these changes to a standalone `/lib/uip119/hoon` file, which can be
  integrated into `/sys/hoon/hoon` as part of a future `hoon` Kelvin decrement.
  - `+ur` and `+uq` are designed to be drop-in replacements for `+us` and `+ut`,
    respectively.
  - Optionally, introduce `$+` hints to common types recognized by `+doxx:ur`
    in `/sys/hoon/hoon`.
  - Optionally, consider making the internal `+us` configuration more
    accessible (like the [`+rs` door][stdlib-rs]) at the cost of backward
    compatibility (breaking change to all external `+us` door invocations).

## Rationale

- Using an embedded and customizable pretty printer facility in `+us` has two
  major advantages:
  - The existing "special case" print functions (e.g. for `$tree`s, `$face`s,
    etc.) can be integrated into a unified and holistic architecture.
  - Each `$type`-based print function can be fine tuned to the abstraction
    layer of the developer—core developers can use verbose, near-noun
    representations and app developers can use terse, near-`$+`/`%know`
    presentations.
- Presenting type nesting failures as diffs reduces output noise, drastically
  reducing deciphering time and improving developer experience.

## Backwards Compatibility

- Development can safely be performed using parallel arms and structures,
  enabling extensive vetting/testing prior to integration.
- Using the new stack of `$type`-related structures will break backward
  compatibility and require and `hoon` Kelvin decrement.
- Replacing `+us` and `+ut` with their the parallel counterparts `+ur` and
  `+uq` will break backward compatibility with all code dependent on pretty
  printer outputs, but will retain interface continuity. Optionally, the `+us`
  door can be replaced to make pretty printer overriding simpler at the cost of
  an interface discontinuity.
