## Abstract

Urbit needs to support some way for a client to efficiently obtain the most recent version of some value over the network.  This functionality is a basic piece of most HTTP interactions -- the client sends a GET request for some data at a path, and the server responds using its latest state corresponding to that path -- but this is not yet supported in the scry namespace, and because the scry namespace is immutable, paths cannot be re-bound to new values, so request-at-latest is not an intrinsic feature.

This document proposes adding a non-referentially-transparent request type, called `%pine`, to Urbit's network protocol.  A `%pine` request includes a scry path with no `$case` (revision number or date), since due to the ever-present potential for clock skew between any two machines, only the publishing ship knows its own latest date.  A `%pine` request is resolved by a `%pine` response, which wraps a `[path data]` scry binding at a fully qualified scry path, whose `$case` was resolved by the publishing ship.

## Motivation

There are many ways to design a `%pine` request system.  This proposal is intended to satisfy the following properties:

- It requires only a small addition to existing protocols.
- It builds on existing Directed Messaging routing infrastructure and Pending Interest Tables.
- It does not introduce any potential for Byzantine faults in the scry namespace, i.e. conflicting bindings at the same path.
- It does not require any formal state on publishers (meaning no Arvo events).
- It establishes a clear distinction between mutable and immutable requests.

## Specification

A `%pine` request packet is labeled as such in the 32-bit header.  This disambiguates it from `%peek` request packets, which include a fully qualified scry path and must be treated differently over the network.

When a publisher hears a `%pine` request packet, it interpolates the current date into the request's case-less scry path to obtain a fully qualified scry path.  It peforms the scry request, then wraps the first packet of the scry response in a `%pine` response envelope to indicate that the response is intended to resolve a `%pine` request, rather than resolving a fully qualified `%peek` request.

The `%pine` enveloping on request and response is used to prevent ambiguity between mutable and immutable responses on the publisher and relays.  When a relay hears a `%pine` request packet, it adds that to a separate pending interest table just for `%pine`s, not the PIT for immutable `%peek` requests.  This way, when the `%pine` response arrives at the relay, the relay knows to use that response to resolve the `%pine`.

The `%pine` response packet is used to establish the case for a `%pine` request.  When the requesting ship hears the `%pine` response packet, it remembers the case and uses that to request the rest of the value as an immutable `%peek` request.  This memory could be transient in the runtime, or potentially injected into Arvo as an event.  Either approach should be legitimate.

Relays should not cache `%pine` responses as such, since they immediately become stale as soon as they are received.  If caching on relays is desirable, then this system could be augmented by including a time-to-live (TTL) value on `%pine` request packets.  A relay would only resolve an incoming `%pine` request using a cached response if the amount of time that had elapsed since receiving the response was less than the new request's TTL.

### Rationale for `%pine` Enveloping

To understand why the separation between `%pine` packets and other packets is needed, consider an alternative design that did not distinguish `%pine` responses from fully qualified responses, and the scenario in which two ships make requests from the same publisher.  One is a `%peek` request for an old piece of data at a historical date, say a month in the past.  The other request is a `%pine`.  Both requests arrive at a relay in quick succession, before either one can be resolved.  The first response packet that arrives is the response to the `%peek` at the old date.  The relay would end up using this response to satisfy the `%pine`, yielding a misleading, stale result on the requesting ship.

Since the relay would have no way of knowing that the response packet was not intended to resolve the `%pine` request, it would just check for a simple caseless match on the paths and conclude that it should send the stale response back to the transport address that had sent the `%pine` request, and the sending ship would also have no way of knowing it was stale.

Author's note: I am quite open to other ideas for identifying `%pine` responses, but it seems to me to be a delicate part of the design space.  

## Backward Compatibility

New ships would need to be able to perform an explicit protocol negotiation to discover whether peer ships support `%pine`.  This should not be particularly complex or unusual compared to other protocol upgrades.

## Security Considerations

It could be worth adding a TTL as described earlier, to mitigate denial of service attacks involving large numbers of `%pine` requests sent to the same publisher in a short amount of time.  Without a TTL or other mitigation mechanism, such a request storm could swamp the publishing ship by requiring it to perform a full Arvo `+peek` call and inter-process communication overhead on every packet.  A ship could disallow packets with particularly short TTLs (maybe even configurable on a per-path basis) to enforce an upper bound on the number of `+peek` calls that could be caused per second.
