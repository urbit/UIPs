## Abstract

This proposal enables cross-ship subscriptions using the remote scry protocol
(Fine) by making scry requests for paths that are known to be part of
publications "sticky" on the publisher, so they persist long enough that when
the path is "grown" (i.e., any time data is published on the path), the response
can be sent down to requesters immediately.

Sending responses immediately only works if Vere somehow finds out from Arvo
that a request can now be fulfilled. This proposal advocates for Arvo to emit an
effect whenever a new piece of concrete data is added to the scry namespace
(i.e. "grown"): a Clay commit with new files, a Gall `%grow` move from an agent
to bind a new path, or Eyre binding a new static response to a mutable URL.

## Definitions

TODO: ~rovnys-ricfer will you please fill in some basic definitions such as for
"scry path", "subscription", etc.? It's almost as if we need to write Fine as an
already-completed UIP.

## Motivation

In Fine, a "subscription" is the ability for a ship to request data at a path in
the global scry namespace which has not yet been bound with data (i.e.
"published").

However, the basic Fine implementation does not support low-latency
subscriptions.

If the subscriber ship has received the `n`th datum in a subscription, it can
use Fine to ask for the `n+1`th datum by requesting data at the path that's
identical to the first except for an incremented revision number. The subscriber
will retry that request on a timer indefinitely, so after the publisher has
grown the new path binding, the subscriber ship will receive the new datum, but
only after half the retry interval on average.

Given the current Fine backoff interval of two minutes, a request for the next
datum will only resolve after a minute. This is too much latency for many Urbit
applications, including most social applications such as chat.

Ideally, Urbit wouldn't need any session-based protocol to ensure low latency on
responses to scry requests whose paths haven't been bound yet when the publisher
receives the request; instead, the basic remote scry protocol would handle this.

## Specification

Whenever a new subscribable scry path is grown, Arvo emits a `[%grew path]`
effect to the runtime. The runtime distributes the effect to all its I/O drivers
in case any of them have listeners for this path. TODO: For now, only the first
I/O driver which accepts the effect is allowed by the runtime to act upon it (in
the future, many should be allowed). (This idea might be a good candidate for a
"Future Work" section in this UIP).

### Subscribable Paths

The set of subscribable paths is currently:

- `/g/x` paths bound explicitly by a Gall agent
- `/c/z` paths asking for the root folders of Clay desks, at numeric revisions
- `/e/x/cache` paths asking Eyre for static responses to HTTP requests

Other scry paths do not easily support detecting changes, so they cannot be
subscribed to. This set could change with each Kelvin update, but it is a formal
part of the interface at a given Kelvin.

### Runtime Effect Handling

The runtime will distribute the `%grew` effect to all its I/O drivers. The I/O
drivers which wish to enable subscriptions must hold onto pending requests in a
cache for slightly longer than the subscriber's backoff timer (currently
defaulted to two minutes).

When an I/O driver receives the `%grew` effect it will:

1. Place the data in its scry cache.  
   a. TODO: Consider whether we should implement either a cache expiration
   policy, cache size limit, or a data store optimization algorithm to prevent
   the cache from growing too large.
2. Send responses to any pending requests already in its requests cache and
   remove the pending requests from its requests cache after sending the
   responses.

When an I/O driver receives a scry request, it will:

1. Check its scry cache for the requested path.  
   a. If the path is in the cache, send the response immediately.  
   b. If the path is not in the cache, send the request to Arvo and place the
   request in the requests cache.

For timing, the behavior of the requests cache is as follows: Requests are
limited to one per-ship per-path. Requests automatically expire after two
minutes. TODO: pick back up from here.

### Initialization

Without knowing the latest case for a path, Vere can't drop repeated requests
for a future revision that would block, which could be costly, since each
failing request would incur an IPC roundtrip and an Arvo activation. One simple
answer is that on process restart, Clay would emit the latest revision for all
desks, Eyre would emit the latest revision for all static responses, and Gall
would emit the latest revision for all paths bound by all agents.

To prevent a slow process restart, ideally the initialization would not involve
one big request or set of effects from Arvo, but would be done incrementally for
each new path that someone requests after a Vere restart. Such a system would
need to be designed separately.

## Rationale

An
[earlier proposal](https://gist.github.com/belisarius222/390daafc146f7c6ddd98836e61dc307f)
for scry-based subscriptions defined a new network protocol for managing
ship-to-ship sessions. Within a session, the publisher would be responsible for
remembering a request for a future datum and honoring it as soon as possible.

This proposal is lighter-weight and does not introduce a session abstraction,
which is often considered distasteful in Urbit circles because it introduces a
generally unnecessary statefulness into the networking stack -- Ames and Fine
are packet-oriented connectionless protocols, and it would be a shame to lose
that.

Some more background on the problem can be found here:

## Backward Compatibility

TODO Either explicit protocol negotiation to check if a publisher supports
sticky scry, or fall back to polling, possibly with a shorter re-send interval.

This system should burn a Kelvin, and it might be a good idea to increment the
Fine protocol version too.

## Security Considerations

For unencrypted scry, there are no security implications for this proposal. Once
encrypted scry is part of the system, extending this proposal to ensure requests
for future encrypted paths are still resolved by growths of the corresponding
decrypted path is a remaining piece of work to be done.

One option could be to move the revision number of an encrypted path out of the
encrypted section of the path into plaintext. This would be a metadata leak, but
it might be worth it if it allows for good subscription semantics. It could be
especially important for relays to participate in subscriptions later, since
relays can't decrypt the paths.
